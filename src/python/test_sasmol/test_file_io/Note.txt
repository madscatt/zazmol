done:

working on resource error warnings in:

test_intg_file_io_Files_close_dcd_write.py

import warnings

and in setup

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

will remove the stale open() file warnings that could be also removed by using with open () etc.





The notes below are in relation to the state of tests for these modules from SASMOL (for sassie 2.0) not in relation to the Python 3.X port


replaced all sassie w/ sasmol

need to fix relative path using os.path.join()


opendcd: the file will be cleared and overwritten if existing. Is this expected? Or should we name it open_dcd_write
opendcd: should we write a header to it?

Should the following two be moved/removed from sasio since they are never used?
writedcd_header: the function will write a header to a dcd file, without explicitly returning anything.
writedcd_step: same thing above

opendcd (integrated with dcdio.open_dcd_read): can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
closedcd (integrated with dcdio.close_dcd_write): can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
open_dcd_read: can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
close_dcd_read: can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems

readdcd:>=1.2g (>1.0g)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

read_dcd_step: need to be excuted frame times in order to get the right coor

read_pdb: will the default for charge to be '  ' and the default occupancy to be 0.0? Should occupancy/beta/charge be a number instead of a string?

initialize_children: is betas necessary? This will make the mask array huge

test_intg_sasio_Files_close_dcd_read.py will fail on entropy with segmentation fault.
